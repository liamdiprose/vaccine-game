We plan to base the game off the Kurzgesagt video on vaccines:

## Game ideas 

Decade-by-decade levels demonstrating the need for vaccines
Each level is an open-plan tower-defence that is analogous to the immune system.

## How we educate

* The user needs to place towers which will be components of the immune system.
  * Memory cells
  * Antibodies (projectiles)


## Relate to real-life

* Show a health bar 
* Show newspaper articles from the year showing the mindset back then (measles => bad)


## 24 Hour deadline

* Use art from video
